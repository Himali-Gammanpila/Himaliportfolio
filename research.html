    <h2 >Research Interest</h2>
    <pw>I am a mathematician specializing in differential geometry. My research focuses on variational problems in geometry, including the analysis of elastic curves and minimal surfaces. I am particularly interested in the stability and index theory of geometric objects, as well as their behavior in different ambient spaces. In addition, I am exploring the intersection of differential geometry and machine learning, with a focus on geometric approaches to data analysis, learning on manifolds, and the development of structure-preserving algorithms. Through this work, I aim to deepen the understanding of the interplay between geometry, analysis, and emerging data-driven methods.</p>
